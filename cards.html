          When you head to the Cliffs of Moher, you're coming for one of two things: the staggering height of the rock face, and the stunning views from the top.
          
          Soaring to 214m, the striated stone reaches its long fingers southward to counties Cork and Kerry beyond, and from O'Brien's Tower those with a keen eye may even be able to spot the Aran Islands to the north.
          
          As the sea spray fills the air with the invigorating freshness of the Wild Atlantic Way, it's hard not to feel as though you're braving the ocean from the prow of a magnificent ship. To make the most of the magic, nothing quite beats a wind-whipped trek across the clifftop, the edges peaking slightly upwards like the crests of the waves that roll endlessly below. Try the Doolin Cliff Walk: it leads you down the full length of the well-worn trail to the hugely informative Visitor Center, set into the hillside like a hobbit house.

Head out beyond the city, and the UNESCO Biosphere of Dublin Bay opens up with coastal walks, little villages, wide sea views and rugged mountain backdrops. Take to the Dublin mountains for a hike, go rock-climbing in Dalkey Quarry, walk the cliff path at Howth or join the Dublin hardcore who sea-swim whatever the weather. There's an adventure around every corner.</p>

          Galway is one of the brightest and most intriguing jewels of the West of Ireland. It marks the halfway point on the Wild Atlantic Way and is the only city on the entire 2500km route. The city is wild and bohemian, and at the same time full of culture, artistry, exceptional food and music. As well as being a popular seaside destination with long sandy beaches, Galway is also a thriving and cosmopolitan city centre. It is always a joy to explore with its wonderful cobbled streets, colourful shop facades, and its offbeat café/bar culture. Galway is also well known for its proliferation of festivals and civic events, with huge crowds gathering for the much-celebrated Galway International Arts Festival, the craic of the Galway Races, the spectacular Macnas Halloween Parade and numerous other events throughout the year. Ireland’s great traditions of hospitality have their place in the city too, with turf fires and traditional music featuring in many of the city’s pubs. We look forward to welcoming you soon!</p>

        <p>Blue-Flag Inch Beach lies on Daingean Bay on the Dingle Peninsula. Visitors to Dingle will find this place well worth a stop as it is a perfect place to come at any time of the year to blow away the cobwebs.

          When you actually see Inch beach the name may seem a little ironic for its expansive sands stretch for around 4 miles, across the entire south-west side of the Inch Peninsula.  There is a surfing school directly on the beach and the place is popular with surfers and other water-sports enthusiasts. 
          
          There is plenty of parking along the length of the beach.  It is possible to drive your car right onto the sands, although cars which rive too far down the beach often get stuck in the sand. 
          
          Inch Beach has views over Dingle Bay and the mountains of Kerry.  It has been used as the set for various films, including Ryan’s Daughter. 
          
          Sammy’s Restaurant is directly next to the beach and serves Dingle Bay oysters as well as the usual streaks and cakes.</p>

          Ross Castle sits on the edge of Killarney’s lower lake and was built by O’Donoghue Mór in the 15th century. The Castle came into the hands of the Brownes who became the Earls of Kenmare and owned an extensive portion of the lands that are now part of Killarney National Park . Legend has it that O’Donoghue still exists in a deep slumber under the waters of Lough Leane. On the first morning of May every seven years he rises from the lake on his magnificent white horse and circles the lake. Anyone catching a glimpse of him is said to be assured of good fortune for the rest of their lives. The large rock at the entrance to the bay is known as O’Donoghue’s prison. Ross Castle was the last stronghold in Munster to hold out against Cromwell. It was eventually taken by General Ludlow in 1652.</p>

          The Wild Atlantic Way, 1600 miles (2600 km) in length, is one of the longest defined coastal routes in the world. It winds its way all along the Irish west coast from the Inishowen Peninsula in the north down to the picturesque town of Kinsale, County Cork, in the south. This route from start to finish unfolds the wonders of nature, the power of the ocean and its imprint on the west coast of Ireland, and the stunning countryside in all its diversity. Enchanting villages are nestled along the coast as well as ancient monuments – their origins having long sunk into the mists of oblivion dot the landscape. Behind every bend on this magical coastal road a new delight awaits.

          The wild Atlantic with its unrestrained and untameable tides and storms has continuously been moulding the west coast of Ireland. With a constant meeting of water and land, a deeply indented and wild terrain has emerged with towering cliffs, spellbinding bays and beaches, mystical islands, always changing and never reaching the end. In the isolation or perhaps expressed in a different way living near and with the Atlantic at your doorstep has ensured that old traditions and the Irish language have been preserved. A trip along the Wild Atlantic Way is also an encounter with the past.</p>

          The Causeway Coast and Glens region is rightly known for its spectacular scenery. But off the beaten track there are also many equally spectacular hidden gems to discover. And you’ll find eight of them here. If you love the outdoors, there are rugged coastal walks, secluded hiking trails and forest paths. There are designated places of Outstanding Natural Beauty, havens for butterflies, wildlife and rare birds; protected ancient landscapes and woodlands, carpeted with bluebells in spring.If you’re interested in history and heritage you’ll find monuments, follies and ruins, megalithic stones and pilgrimage sites.Looking for activities? Try kayaking or take a cruise along a tidal estuary or quiet stretch of river – where if you’re lucky, you may even spot herons or otters. There are plenty...</p>

          Ireland's second city is first in every important respect – at least according to the locals, who cheerfully refer to it as the 'real capital of Ireland'. It's a liberal, youthful and cosmopolitan place that was badly hit by economic recession but is now busily reinventing itself with spruced-up streets, revitalised stretches of waterfront, and – seemingly – an artisan coffee bar on every corner. There's a bit of a hipster scene, but the best of the city is still happily traditional – snug pubs with live-music sessions, restaurants dishing up top-quality local produce, and a genuinely proud welcome from the locals.!</p>

          Irelands largest offshore island is Achill with its golden beaches, unspoiled beauty and great island skies full of ever changing cloudscapes, continually caressing its peaks and valleys. Achill is joined to the mainland by a bridge at Achill Sound and about half of the island is a Gaeltacht region.  The island has some of the highest and most spectacular sheer cliff faces in Europe, which seem to stand guard before Achill’s heather clad hills as they hurry towards the Atlantic Ocean. It is approximately 2 hours drive from Galway to Achill in Co. Mayo.

          Achill is dotted with small villages and magnificent sandy blue flag beaches. The western end of the island is dominated by the majestic 668m Croaghaun Mountain and two other mountains on the island are Slievemore, the highest at 671m and Minaun at 466m. Sea Angling, diving, golf, archaeology and other outdoor activities are common on the island but the peace and quiet is all pervasive.</p>
